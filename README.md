# Exercises.JS

In this repository are some of the exercises used to expand my knowledge in the Javascript programming language, You will find two types of exercises in this section the "Question and Answer Exercises" and the other small projects.

1- Question and Answer Exercises
In this folder there are some text exercises with questions and answers about various Javascript contents to identify which parts of the exercises represent questions or answers, the questions will always be written in the "normal" way and the answers will be commented ( // ) on the right side of the screen.

2- Small projects
the other items in this section are some small projects I used to study JavaScript
